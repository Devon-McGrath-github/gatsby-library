  Odin Project - Libray Exercise - built from a Gatsby TypeScript Starter

## ðŸš€ Getting to know Gatsby

Need to familiarise myself with Gatsby for a potential project, and working my way through the Odin Project course.
So I'm completing the Odin Project [Library](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) Exercise using React/Gatsby to learn a bit of both at the same time.

Implementation is very quick, have not split code into separate components as it should be done, and state has a very simple implementation.
A few outstanding typescript errors to resolve (don't affect function, but represent less than optimal implementation - still lots to learn regarding TS)

The quick implementation has meant that I don't have access to some React features that would be best to handle deleting Books from the myLibrary array and updating the read status (such as passing the ID). As such I'm leaving this project as is, a basic app with very little polish that has helped familiarise my knowledge of Object constructors and Gatsby. Next up, Factory functions
