## ðŸš€ Getting to know Gatsby

Need to familiarise myself with Gatsby for a potential project, and working my way through the Odin Project course.
So I'm completing the Odin Project [Library](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) with Gatsby to improve a little at both.

Implementation is a bit lazy, have not split into separate components for ease of learning concepts.
